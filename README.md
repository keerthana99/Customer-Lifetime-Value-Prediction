# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
Customer lifetime Value is the forecasting of net profits that connect to a specific customer during their lifetime relationship with a business. To state it more simply, CLV is the financial value of a customer’s relationship over the lifetime of the organization’s relationship with that customer.
